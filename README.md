This web application is made for the Final Project of COMP 3033. We have designed a calendar web application using a MEVN stack based on our proposal below:
<ol>
  <li>At minimum:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add events, tasks, and reminders</li>
    <li>Delte events, tasks, and reminders</li>
    <li>Edit events, tasks, and reminders</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hopefuls:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Different view layouts (e.g., weekly, yearly)</li>
    <li>Assigning different 'calendars'</li>
    <li>User sign in</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Above and beyond</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Make it collaborative</li>
    <li>Adding animations to make it look better</li>
    <li>Linking due dates to documents</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

To run this application, the following libraries must be preinstalled to make the application work and can installed by using the npm install [ library ] command:
<ul>
  <li>dayjs</li>
  <li>axios</li>
</ul>
